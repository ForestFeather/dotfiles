THIS IS TO SET UP AN AUTOSSH TUNNEL.  This is useful for say, a box behind a firewall, that wants to be connected to; but you can't open ports or whatnot.
What this does is creates an autossh connection to connect out, then allow a reverse tunnel on a chosen port.
For security, a special user is made to allow the tunnel to behave.

Once the tunnel is running on the (restricted) box, you can connect to the (restricted) box from the (target_host) box by going 'ssh user@localhost -p tunnel_port'.

We use autossh so it automatically tries to renew the connection if it drops.

Install autossh:
add autossh

Make user first on restricted box:
sudo useradd -m -s /sbin/nologin autossh


Make user on target_host box (be sure to store this password for later use if necessary):
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash autossh
autosshpass=`date | md5sum | cut -c1-10` && echo "$autosshpass" | echo -e "$autosshpass\n$autosshpass" | passwd autossh

Generate all keys for autossh user on restricted box:
sudo su - autossh -s /bin/bash
ssh-keygen -t dsa
ssh-keygen -t rsa
ssh-keygen -t ed25519

Upload keys from restricted box to target_host box (as autossh user):
ssh-copy-id target_box -p port

Create and update service script for restricted box:
cp autossh.service.example autossh.service
vim autossh.service (follow instructions)
sudo cp autossh.service /etc/systemd/service/autossh.service

Reload SystemD and enable, then finally check that it's working:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start autossh
sudo systemctl status autossh
sudo systemctl enable autossh
